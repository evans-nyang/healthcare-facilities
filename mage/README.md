# Healthcare Facilities

## Mage AI

Mage is an open-source, hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data. âœ¨

We'll use the Mage platform to author and share _healthcare_ data pipelines.
If you'd like to learn a bit more about Mage, check out the docs [here](https://docs.mage.ai/introduction/overview).

## Getting started

This repo contains a Docker Compose template for getting started with a new Mage project. It requires Docker to be installed locally. If Docker is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

You can start by cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evans-nyang/healthcare-facilities.git
```

Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd healthcare-facilities/mage
```

Rename `.env_example_mage` to simply `.env`â€” this will _ensure_ the file is not committed to Git by accident, since it contains the credentials. Change the values in the `.env` file to match your environment.

Now, build the container

```bash
docker compose build
```

Finally, start the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Now, navigate to <http://localhost:6789> in your browser! ðŸš€

### What just happened?

We just initialized a new mage repository. It will be present in your project under the name `mage`. If you changed the varable `PROJECT_NAME` in the `.env` file, it will be named whatever you set it to.

This repository should have the following structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ healthcare
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __pycache__
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ charts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ custom
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data_exporters
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data_loaders
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dbt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ extensions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ interactions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pipelines
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scratchpads
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ transformers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ io_config.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```
