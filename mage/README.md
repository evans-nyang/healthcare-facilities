## Introduction

This project is a simple demonstration of how to use Mage to transform and integrate data. We'll be working with a dataset of healthcare facilities in Kenya. The dataset contains information about the facilities, such as the facility name, type, county, and location.

The goal of this project is to transform the data into a format that can be easily consumed by other systems. We'll use the Mage platform to author and share _healthcare_ data pipelines: creation of a pipeline that reads the data, transforms it, and writes it to a new location.

Mage is an open-source, hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data. âœ¨

If you'd like to learn a bit more about Mage, check out the docs [here](https://docs.mage.ai/introduction/overview).

Data modeling and transformation will be done using dbt, a command-line tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse more effectively. dbt does this by allowing analysts to write select statements, test the output, and deploy the results to their warehouse.

### Data Sources and ETL Process  

The data sources for this project are the [Kenya Master Health Facility List](https://kmhfr.health.go.ke/public/facilities) and the [Kenya Health Facilities GeoJSON](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kenya-health-facilities).
The ETL process is as follows:

1. Download the Kenya Master Health Facility List from the [Kenya Master Health Facility List](https://kmhfr.health.go.ke/public/facilities) website.

2. Download the Kenya Health Facilities GeoJSON from the [Kenya Health Facilities GeoJSON](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kenya-health-facilities) website.

3. Extract the data from the Kenya Master Health Facility List and the Kenya Health Facilities GeoJSON.

4. Transform the data from the Kenya Master Health Facility List and the Kenya Health Facilities GeoJSON.

5. Load the data into the database.

### Data Summary

The attributes of the healthcare facilities dataset are as follows:

- `healthcare_facilities` table
  - `code` (integer): Unique identifier for the healthcare facility.
  - `name` (string): Name of the healthcare facility.
  - `registration number` (string): Registration number of the healthcare facility.
  - `keph level` (string): Level of the healthcare facility.
  - `facility type` (string): Type of the healthcare facility.
  - `owner` (string): Owner of the healthcare facility.
  - `regulatory body` (string): Regulatory body of the healthcare facility.
  - `bed` (integer): Bed capacity of the healthcare facility.
  - `cots` (integer): Cots capacity of the healthcare facility.
  - `county` (string): County where the healthcare facility is located.
  - `constituency` (string): Constituency where the healthcare facility is located.
  - `sub_county` (string): Sub-county where the healthcare facility is located.
  - `ward` (string): Ward where the healthcare facility is located.
  - `operation status` (string): Operation status of the healthcare facility.
  - `open_whole_day` (string): Whether the healthcare facility is open the whole day.
  - `open_public_holidays` (string): Whether the healthcare facility is open on public holidays.
  - `open_weekends` (string): Whether the healthcare facility is open on weekends.
  - `open_late_night` (string): Whether the healthcare facility is open late at night.
  - `service names` (string): Names of the services offered by the healthcare facility.
  - `approved` (string): Whether the healthcare facility is approved.
  - `public_visible` (string): Whether the healthcare facility is publicly visible.
  - `closed` (string): Whether the healthcare facility is closed.

## Getting started

This repo contains a Docker Compose template for getting started with a new Mage project. It requires Docker to be installed locally. If Docker is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd healthcare-facilities/mage
```

Rename `.env_example_mage` to simply `.env`â€” this will _ensure_ the file is not committed to Git by accident, since it contains the credentials. Change the values in the `.env` file to match your environment.

Now, build the container

```bash
docker compose build
```

Finally, start the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Now, navigate to <http://localhost:6789> in your browser! ðŸš€

### Extras

We just initialized a new mage repository. It will be present in your project under the name `mage`. If you changed the varable `PROJECT_NAME` in the `.env` file, it will be named whatever you set it to.
