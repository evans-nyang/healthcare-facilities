## Introduction

This project is a simple demonstration of how to use Mage to transform and integrate data. We'll be working with a dataset of healthcare facilities in Kenya. The dataset contains information about the facilities, such as the facility name, type, county, and location.

The goal of this project is to transform the data into a format that can be easily consumed by other systems. We'll use the Mage platform to author and share _healthcare_ data pipelines: creation of a pipeline that reads the data, transforms it, and writes it to a new location.

Mage is an open-source, hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data. âœ¨

## Getting started

This repo contains a Docker Compose template for getting started with a new Mage project. It requires Docker to be installed locally. If Docker is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

You can start by cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evans-nyang/healthcare-facilities.git
```

Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd healthcare-facilities/mage
```

Rename `.env_example_mage` to simply `.env`â€” this will _ensure_ the file is not committed to Git by accident, since it contains the credentials. Change the values in the `.env` file to match your environment.

Now, build the container

```bash
docker compose build
```

Finally, start the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Now, navigate to <http://localhost:6789> in your browser! ðŸš€

### What just happened?

We just initialized a new mage repository. It will be present in your project under the name `mage`. If you changed the varable `PROJECT_NAME` in the `.env` file, it will be named whatever you set it to.

This repository should have the following structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ healthcare
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __pycache__
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ charts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ custom
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data_exporters
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data_loaders
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dbt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ extensions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ interactions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pipelines
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scratchpads
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ transformers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ io_config.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```
