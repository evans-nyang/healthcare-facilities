# Healthcare Facilities

## Mage AI

Mage is an open-source, hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data. ✨

We'll use the Mage platform to author and share _healthcare_ data pipelines.
If you'd like to learn a bit more about Mage, check out our docs [here](https://docs.mage.ai/introduction/overview).

## Let's get started

This repo contains a Docker Compose template for getting started with a new Mage project. It requires Docker to be installed locally. If Docker is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

You can start by cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evans-nyang/healthcare-facilities.git
```

Navigate to the repo:

```bash
cd healthcare-facilities/mage
```

Rename `.env_example_mage` to simply `.env`— this will _ensure_ the file is not committed to Git by accident, since it _will_ contain credentials in the future.

Now, let's build the container

```bash
docker compose build
```

Finally, start the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Now, navigate to <http://localhost:6789> in your browser! Voila! You're ready to get started.

### What just happened?

We just initialized a new mage repository. It will be present in your project under the name `mage`. If you changed the varable `PROJECT_NAME` in the `.env` file, it will be named whatever you set it to.

This repository should have the following structure:

```
.
├── .env
├── healthcare
│   ├── __pycache__
│   ├── charts
│   ├── custom
│   ├── data_exporters
│   ├── data_loaders

│   ├── interactions
│   ├── pipelines
│   ├── scratchpads
│   ├── transformers
│   ├── utils
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── io_config.yaml
│   ├── metadata.yaml
│   └── requirements.txt
